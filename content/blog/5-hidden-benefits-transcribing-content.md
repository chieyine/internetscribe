1.  **Better Editing:** It's faster to edit text than to scrub through a timeline.
2.  **Translation:** You can't translate audio easily. You can translate text instantly.
3.  **Searchability:** Find that one quote from 3 years ago.
4.  **Learning:** Reading is faster than listening. Your audience might prefer to skim.
5.  **Licensing:** It's easier to license text content (e.g., for a book) than audio.
