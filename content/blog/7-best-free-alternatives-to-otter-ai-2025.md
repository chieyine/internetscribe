# 7 Best Free Alternatives to Otter.ai in 2025 (No Sign-Up)

Otter.ai used to be the hero. Now it's the villain.

You know the drill: you're recording a lecture or a meeting, and suddenly—bam. You hit the 300-minute monthly limit. The recording stops. The "Upgrade to Pro" banner slaps you in the face.

It’s annoying. It’s greedy. And frankly, you don't need to put up with it.

The transcription game has changed. You don't need to pay $16.99 a month just to turn audio into text. You don't even need to create an account.

Here are the 7 best free alternatives to Otter.ai that actually work. No fluff, no paywalls, no BS.

## 1. InternetScribe (The "Just Works" Option)

**Best for:** Everyone who hates sign-up forms.

Look, we built [InternetScribe](/) because we were tired of Otter's limits too. It’s simple:

- **No Account:** You don't log in. You don't give us your email. You just upload.
- **Unlimited:** Transcribe 10 minutes or 10 hours. We don't care.
- **Private:** Your audio stays in your browser. It doesn't go to some cloud server where we can listen to your secret plans.
- **Free AI Features:** Summaries? Translation? Included.

If you want to drag, drop, and get text, this is it.

## 2. Google Live Transcribe (The Android Savior)

**Best for:** Android users who need real-time text.

If you have a Pixel or a Samsung, you already have a powerhouse in your pocket. Google Live Transcribe is scary accurate.

- **The Good:** It’s instant. It handles background noise like a champ.
- **The Bad:** It’s live only. You can’t upload an MP3 you recorded yesterday. And if you’re on an iPhone, you’re out of luck.

---

## 3. Microsoft Word Online (The Sleeper Pick)

**Best for:** People already stuck in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Did you know Word does this? Yeah, neither do most people. If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription (or a free school account), the "Dictate" button has a "Transcribe" sibling.

- **The Good:** It identifies speakers automatically. It puts the text right into your doc.
- **The Bad:** It has a 300-minute limit too (classic Microsoft). But hey, it’s another 300 minutes if you burned through your Otter allowance.

---

## 4. OpenAI Whisper (The Nerd Option)

**Best for:** Coders and privacy freaks.

Whisper is the engine under the hood of half the tools on this list. It’s open-source, free, and incredibly smart.

- **The Good:** Zero limits. Zero cost. Maximum privacy (if you run it locally).
- **The Bad:** You need to know how to use a command line. If "Terminal" scares you, skip this.

## 5. oTranscribe (The Manual Workhorse)

**Best for:** When AI fails and you need 100% accuracy.

Sometimes AI gets it wrong. Accents, mumbling, heavy metal in the background—AI chokes. oTranscribe isn't an auto-transcriber. It’s a player that lets you type without losing your mind.

- **The Good:** Shortcuts to rewind, slow down, and pause while typing.
- **The Bad:** You have to type it yourself. Good luck.

---

## 6. Speechnotes (The Chrome Extension)

**Best for:** Dictating emails or short notes.

If you just want to talk at your computer and see words appear, Speechnotes works. It runs in Chrome and uses Google’s speech engine.

- **The Good:** Fast and simple.
- **The Bad:** It’s for dictation, not files. You can’t upload a podcast episode.

---

## 7. VEED.io (The Video Tool)

**Best for:** Creating subtitles for TikTok/Reels.

VEED is a video editor first, but its auto-subtitle tool is solid.

- **The Good:** Great for visual people. You can style the text instantly.
- **The Bad:** The free tier is stingy. Watermarks. Short limits. Use it for a 60-second clip, not a 2-hour interview.

---

## The Verdict

Stop paying Otter rent for a tool you use occasionally.

- Need **live** transcription on your phone? Use **Google**.
- Need to **upload files** without limits? Use **[InternetScribe](/)**.
- Need to **code** your own solution? Use **Whisper**.

The era of the 300-minute limit is over. Don't let them hold your audio hostage.
