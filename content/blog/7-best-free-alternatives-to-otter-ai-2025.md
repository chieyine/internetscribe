## Why People Are Leaving Otter.ai

Before diving into alternatives, let's understand why so many users are searching for Otter replacements:

### 1. The 300-Minute Limit

Otter.ai's free plan caps you at 300 transcription minutes per month—roughly 5 hours. For anyone regularly attending meetings, recording lectures, or processing interviews, that's laughably insufficient.

**Real scenario:** A graduate student transcribing thesis interviews might burn through that limit in a single day of fieldwork.

### 2. Forced Account Creation

Privacy-conscious users bristle at the mandatory sign-up. Your audio files pass through Otter's servers, which raises concerns for anyone handling sensitive data—[lawyers](/blog/privacy-first-transcription-for-legal-professionals), [medical professionals](/blog/safe-transcription-tools-for-medical-dictation), or [journalists protecting sources](/blog/transcribing-nigerian-accents-does-ai-work).

### 3. Premium Features Behind Paywall

Features like custom vocabulary, speaker identification, and integrations require Otter's paid plans ($16.99–$30/month). That adds up to $200–$360 annually for what should be basic functionality.
