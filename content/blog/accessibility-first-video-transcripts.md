Over 5% of the world's population has disabling hearing loss. If your video doesn't have captions, you are excluding millions of people.

## Beyond Hearing Loss

Captions also help:

- Non-native speakers.
- People in noisy environments.
- People who learn better by reading.

## How to Comply

**InternetScribe** makes it free and easy to generate WCAG-compliant transcripts. Just upload your video, export the text, and provide it alongside your media player.
