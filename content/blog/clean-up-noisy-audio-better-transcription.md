Whisper is good, but it's not magic. If your audio is terrible, the transcript will be too.

## Quick Fixes

1.  **Adobe Podcast Enhance:** A free tool to clean up voice audio. Run your file through this first.
2.  **Audacity:** Use the "Noise Reduction" effect.

Once your audio is clean, drop it into **InternetScribe** for near-perfect results.
