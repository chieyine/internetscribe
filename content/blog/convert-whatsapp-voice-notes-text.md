We all have that one friend who sends 5-minute voice notes instead of texting. It's annoying, especially if you're in a meeting or a noisy place and can't listen.

Here is the fastest way to turn that audio into text.

## The Trick

1.  **Save the Audio:** On WhatsApp (Mobile), long-press the voice note -> Share -> Save to Files. On WhatsApp Web, just click the download arrow.
2.  **Open InternetScribe:** Go to [internetscribe.com](https://internetscribe.com) on your phone or computer.
3.  **Upload:** Select the file you just saved.
4.  **Read:** The text will appear instantly.

## Why It Works

WhatsApp uses the OGG or Opus format for voice notes. Many older transcription tools don't support this. **InternetScribe** supports OGG and Opus natively, thanks to the ffmpeg core in Whisper.

## Privacy Note

Since you aren't uploading the voice note to a random server, your friend's private message stays private.
