Court reporting requires 100% accuracy. A single wrong word can change a verdict. That's why humans are still essential.

2.  **Rough Draft:** Get an instant text stream.
3.  **Final Polish:** The stenographer corrects the AI's mistakes rather than typing from scratch.

This hybrid workflow can double productivity.
