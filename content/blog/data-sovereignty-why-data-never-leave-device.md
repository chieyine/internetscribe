"Data is the new oil." And just like oil, everyone wants to extract it from you.

## What is Data Sovereignty?

Data sovereignty means you have complete control over your digital information. It's not sitting on a server in Virginia or Dublin; it's on the device in your hands.

## The Cloud Trap

When you use cloud software (SaaS), you are renting access to your own data. If the company goes bust, changes its terms, or gets hacked, you lose.

## The Local-First Movement

**InternetScribe** is part of the "Local-First" movement. We believe software should work offline, be fast, and respect your ownership.

- **You own the audio.**
- **You own the transcript.**
- **We own nothing.**

Take back control. [Go local](/).
