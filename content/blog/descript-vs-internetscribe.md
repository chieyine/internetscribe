title: "Descript vs. InternetScribe: Which is Best for Podcasters?"
date: "2024-05-31"
description: "Descript is an amazing audio editor, but InternetScribe offers unlimited free transcription. Which one should you use?"
---

Descript revolutionized podcast editing by allowing you to edit audio by editing text. It's a "word processor for audio."

**InternetScribe** isn't an editor; it's a pure transcription engine. So why would a podcaster choose InternetScribe?

## The Cost Factor

Descript's free tier is limited to **1 hour of transcription per month**. For most podcasters, that's not enough even for a single episode.

InternetScribe is **unlimited**. You can transcribe 100 hours of raw footage, and it won't cost you a dime.

## The Workflow

The smart podcaster's workflow:

1.  **Transcribe Raw Footage:** Use **InternetScribe** to transcribe all your raw interviews to find the best clips. It's free and fast.
2.  **Edit:** Import only the best clips into Descript (or your DAW of choice) for the final polish.

## Accuracy

Both tools use advanced AI. Descript uses their own models (and some third-party APIs), while InternetScribe uses OpenAI's Whisper. In many benchmarks, Whisper outperforms proprietary models on difficult audio.

## Conclusion

Use Descript for editing. Use **InternetScribe** for bulk transcription and logging your archives.
