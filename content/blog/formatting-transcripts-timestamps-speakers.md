**InternetScribe** gives you raw text or JSON. Here is how to make it pretty.

1.  **Paragraphs:** Break text every time the idea changes.
2.  **Speakers:** Use "Speaker A:" labels (we're working on automating this!).
3.  **Timestamps:** Insert `[00:12]` every minute or so to help people find their place.

Good formatting makes your content professional.
