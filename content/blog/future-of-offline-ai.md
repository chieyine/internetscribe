For the last decade, the web has been a thin client. Your browser was just a window to powerful servers where the "real work" happened.

That paradigm is shifting.

## The Rise of Local AI

With technologies like **WebAssembly (Wasm)** and **WebGPU**, browsers can now access your computer's hardware directly. This means we can run heavy computations—like neural networks—right in a Chrome tab.

## Why This Changes Everything

1.  **Privacy:** As we've discussed in our [Ultimate Guide](/blog/ultimate-guide-private-ai-transcription), local processing means zero data leakage.
2.  **Cost:** Developers don't need to pay for expensive GPU clusters. The user brings their own compute.
3.  **Latency:** No network round-trips. The AI responds instantly.

## InternetScribe's Role

We are at the forefront of this shift. By running Whisper locally, we're proving that you don't need a backend to build a world-class AI application.

## What's Next?

We're seeing Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 running in the browser too. Soon, you'll be able to transcribe _and_ summarize _and_ chat with your data, all offline.
