Transcription (Audio -> Text) is now a commodity. It's cheap and accurate.

## The Next Frontier: Understanding

The future isn't just text; it's **understanding**.

- **Summarization:** "What were the action items?"
- **Sentiment Analysis:** "Was the customer angry?"
- **Speaker Diarization:** "Who said what?"

## Local LLMs

We predict that by 2025, your browser will not just transcribe the meeting but also email the summary to your team, all without a cloud server.

Stay tuned to **InternetScribe** as we build this future.
