Under GDPR, voice data can be considered "biometric data" if used to identify a person. This places it in a special category of sensitive data (Article 9).

## The Processor vs. Controller Problem

If you use a cloud transcription service, they are a "Data Processor." You need a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with them.

## Simplifying Compliance

If you use **InternetScribe**, there is no Data Processor. You (the user) are the Data Controller, and the processing happens on your own infrastructure (your laptop).

This bypasses the need for complex DPAs and cross-border data transfer assessments.
