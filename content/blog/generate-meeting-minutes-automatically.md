We've all been there. You're in a crucial meeting, trying to listen, participate, and take detailed notes all at the same time. It's impossible to do it all well.

The solution? Record the meeting and let AI handle the minutes.

## The Workflow

Here is a simple, free workflow to automate your meeting notes:

1.  **Record the Meeting:** Use your phone or a simple voice recorder. If it's a Zoom/Teams call, use the built-in recording feature.
2.  **Transcribe:** Upload the audio to [InternetScribe](https://internetscribe.com).
3.  **Summarize:** Use the built-in "Summarize" feature (powered by local AI) or copy the text into ChatGPT/Claude for a structured summary.

## Why Not Use Zoom's Built-in Transcription?

Zoom and Teams have transcription features, but they often require a premium license, and the admin can see everything. Plus, the accuracy isn't always great for technical terms.

**InternetScribe** offers a private alternative. You can record the audio yourself and process it locally. This is perfect for confidential discussions.

## Tips for Better Results

- **Microphone Placement:** Put the recording device in the center of the table.
- **One Speaker at a Time:** Try to avoid talking over each other (easier said than done!).
- **High Quality Audio:** Use the highest quality setting on your recorder.

## Next Steps

Once you have your transcript, you might want to share it with your team. If you're worried about privacy, read our guide on [Private AI Transcription](/blog/ultimate-guide-private-ai-transcription).
