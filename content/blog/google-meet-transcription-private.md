Google Meet has live captions, but they disappear. To save them, you usually need a paid extension.

## The Free Way

1.  **Record the Meeting:** Use a screen recorder.
2.  **Transcribe Later:** Use **InternetScribe** to turn that recording into text.

It's a simple extra step that saves you money and keeps your data private.
