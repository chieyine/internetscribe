title: "Happy Scribe vs. InternetScribe: A Free Alternative"
date: "2024-06-02"
description: "Happy Scribe is a popular paid tool. Can a free, local tool like InternetScribe compete?"
---

Happy Scribe is a solid web-based transcription tool with a nice editor. But it operates on a credit system. You pay per hour of audio.

## The "Free" Trap

Many tools claim to be free but then hit you with a limit. "First 10 minutes free!"

**InternetScribe** is genuinely free. The code is open-source, and the model runs on your hardware. We don't pay for servers, so you don't pay us.

## Features

Happy Scribe has a better built-in editor for correcting text. InternetScribe focuses on getting you the raw text (or subtitles) as fast as possible.

## Export Options

Both support TXT, JSON, and VTT/SRT.

## Conclusion

If you want a polished online editor and don't mind paying, Happy Scribe is good. If you want free, unlimited, private transcription, choose **InternetScribe**.
