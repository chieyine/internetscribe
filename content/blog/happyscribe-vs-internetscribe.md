# HappyScribe vs. InternetScribe: Why Pay for Transcription?

HappyScribe is good. We’re not going to lie. They have a nice interface, good accuracy, and a team of humans if you want to pay extra for perfection.

But here’s the question: **Why are you paying for AI?**

AI transcription is a commodity now. It’s like paying for air. The technology that powers HappyScribe’s automated tier is roughly the same technology that powers free tools.

So, let’s look at the math.

---

## The Cost of "Happy"

HappyScribe’s automated transcription costs **€10 per hour** (or a monthly subscription).

Let’s say you have a 2-hour interview.

- **HappyScribe:** €20.
- **InternetScribe:** €0.

Let’s say you’re a student with 10 hours of lectures.

- **HappyScribe:** €100.
- **InternetScribe:** €0.

See the pattern?

## Feature Fight: What Do You Actually Get?

"But surely," you say, "HappyScribe must have features that justify the cost."

Let's check.

| Feature           | HappyScribe (Paid)      | InternetScribe (Free) |
| :---------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **Transcription** | AI-powered              | AI-powered            |
| **Limit**         | Pay per minute          | **Unlimited**         |
| **Export**        | TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON     | TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON   |
| **Translation**   | Yes                     | **Yes**               |
| **Editor**        | Interactive Text Editor | Basic View            |
| **Human Review**  | Available ($$$)         | No                    |

**The Interactive Editor:** This is HappyScribe’s ace. Their editor lets you click a word to play the audio at that spot. It’s slick. If you are a professional transcriber editing 8 hours a day, it might be worth the money.

**The Reality:** Most of you just want the text. You want to copy-paste a quote into your article, or get a summary of the meeting. You don't need a fancy editor. You need the words.

## The Privacy Problem

When you use HappyScribe (or Otter, or Rev), you upload your file to their cloud. It sits on their servers.

When you use [InternetScribe](/), the processing happens **in your browser**. Your audio file doesn't need to leave your device to be processed if you use the local model (coming soon), or it uses secure stateless processing. We don't store your meetings. We don't train on your voice.

---

## The Verdict

If you need **human perfection** and have a corporate budget, HappyScribe’s human service is great. Go for it.

But if you are paying for **automated** transcription? You’re burning money.

Stop paying for AI. It’s 2025.
