In 1952, Bell Labs created "Audrey," a machine that could recognize digits spoken by a single voice. It was the size of a room.

## The Hidden Markov Model Era

For decades, ASR relied on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). They were statistical and required massive hand-tuning. They powered the early Dragon Dictate systems.

## The Deep Learning Revolution

In 2012, deep neural networks (DNNs) shattered all previous records. Suddenly, Siri and Alexa became possible.

## The Transformer Era

Today, we are in the Transformer era. Models like Whisper don't just "match sounds"; they understand context.

We are living in the golden age of ASR. And with **InternetScribe**, you can run this history on your laptop.
