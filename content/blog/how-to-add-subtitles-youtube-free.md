Did you know that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound? On YouTube, subtitles are crucial for accessibility and SEO. They help Google understand your content and rank it higher.

YouTube's auto-generated captions are okay, but they often make embarrassing mistakes. Here is how to create professional-quality subtitles for free.

## The Process

1.  **Transcribe Your Video:** Drag your video file (MP4, MOV, etc.) into [InternetScribe](https://internetscribe.com).
2.  **Export as VTT or SRT:** Once the transcription is done, click the "Export" button and select "VTT" or "JSON" (we support standard formats).
3.  **Upload to YouTube:** Go to YouTube Studio -> Subtitles -> Add Language -> Upload File -> With Timing.

## Why Use InternetScribe?

- **Privacy:** If you're working on unreleased content, you don't want to upload it to a random cloud converter.
- **Accuracy:** Whisper AI is much better than YouTube's built-in auto-captions, especially for technical terms.
- **Formats:** We support VTT, which is the web standard for subtitles.
