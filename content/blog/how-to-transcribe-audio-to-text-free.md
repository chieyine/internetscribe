Transcribing audio files used to be a pain. You either had to pay expensive per-minute rates to human transcribers or use clunky, inaccurate automated tools that required you to upload your sensitive files to their servers.

But things have changed. With the advent of powerful AI models like OpenAI's Whisper, you can now get near-human accuracy for free, right in your browser.

## Why Transcribe Locally?

Most free transcription tools come with a catch: they want your data. When you upload a meeting recording or a personal voice note to a cloud service, you're trusting them to keep it secure.

**InternetScribe** takes a different approach. It runs entirely on your device. When you drag and drop a file, the AI model is loaded into your browser, and the processing happens on your computer's CPU. Your audio never leaves your machine.

For a deeper dive into why this matters, check out our [Ultimate Guide to Private AI Transcription](/blog/ultimate-guide-private-ai-transcription).

## Step-by-Step Guide

Here is how you can transcribe your first file in seconds:

1.  **Open InternetScribe:** Go to [internetscribe.com](https://internetscribe.com). No login is needed.
2.  **Choose Your Model:** If you have a fast computer, select the "Small" model for better accuracy. For older devices, "Tiny" is lightning fast.
3.  **Upload Your File:** Drag and drop your MP3, WAV, or M4A file into the dropzone.
4.  **Wait for Magic:** The AI will start processing immediately. You'll see the text appear in real-time.
5.  **Export:** Once done, you can download the transcript as a Text file, JSON, or even VTT subtitles for your videos.
