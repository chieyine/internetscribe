# How to Transcribe Audio Without a Subscription

We live in the era of the "forever payment."

Want to watch a movie? Subscription. Want to listen to music? Subscription. Want to turn your own voice recording into text? Believe it or not, subscription.

Companies love subscriptions because you forget to cancel them. They bank on your laziness.

If you have a single audio file you need to transcribe, signing up for a monthly plan is insane. It’s like buying a gym membership because you wanted to use the treadmill once.

Here is how to get your text without the commitment.

## The "One-and-Done" Strategy

You have three options when you refuse to subscribe:

1.  **Pay-as-you-go:** You pay per minute. Fair, but can get expensive.
2.  **Ad-supported:** You pay with your eyeballs. Annoying.
3.  **Truly Free:** You pay nothing. This is where we live.

## Option 1: The Browser-Based Free Tools

This is the sweet spot. Tools like [InternetScribe](/) run in your browser.

- **How it works:** You drag your file in. The AI runs. You get text.
- **The Catch:** Usually none, if the tool is good. Bad tools will limit you to 5 minutes. Good tools (like ours) let you do the whole thing.
- **Why it beats subscriptions:** You don't even have to log in. There is no "cancel subscription" button to find because there is no subscription.

## Option 2: The "Freemium" Shuffle

This is the game you play with Otter, Descript, and the rest.

- **The Move:** Sign up for the free tier. Use the 300 minutes (or whatever crumbs they give you).
- **The Risk:** Once you hit the limit, they lock your data. "Want to see the rest of this transcript? Give us $20."
- **Verdict:** Risky. Only do this for short files.

## Option 3: Local AI (Whisper)

If you have a fast computer (Mac M1/M2/M3 or a PC with a GPU), you can run the AI yourself.

- **The Tool:** OpenAI Whisper.
- **The Cost:** $0.
- **The Setup:** A bit of pain. You need to install Python, FFmpeg, and run commands in a black box with white text.
- **The Payoff:** You own the means of production. No company can ever charge you.
