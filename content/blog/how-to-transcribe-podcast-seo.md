Google can't "listen" to your podcast. It needs text.

## The SEO Strategy

1.  **Full Transcript:** Post the entire transcript on a dedicated page on your site.
2.  **Key Takeaways:** Use the transcript to write a summary blog post.
3.  **Quotes:** Pull out quote cards for social media.

**InternetScribe** makes step 1 free. Just drag your MP3 in and export the text.
