If you have a Zoom recording (MP4 or M4A) and need a transcript, you don't need to pay for Zoom Pro.

1.  **Locate the Recording:** Find the file on your computer (usually in `Documents/Zoom`).
2.  **Drag and Drop:** Open **InternetScribe** and drag the file in.
3.  **Wait:** In a few minutes, you'll have the text.

This works for both cloud recordings (download them first) and local recordings.
