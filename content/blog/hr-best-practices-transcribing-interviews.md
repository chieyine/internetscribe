title: "HR Best Practices: Transcribing Interviews Fairly and Privately"

---

Recording job interviews is a great way to ensure fair hiring. You can review exactly what a candidate said, rather than relying on memory.

## The Privacy Issue

Candidates expect their interviews to be private. Uploading them to a public cloud service might violate GDPR or local labor laws.

## The Solution

Use **InternetScribe** to generate transcripts locally. Keep the data on your secure company network.

## Reducing Bias

Transcripts also help remove accent bias. You can evaluate the candidate's _words_ without being influenced by their voice or delivery.
