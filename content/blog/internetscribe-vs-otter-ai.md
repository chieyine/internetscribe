Otter.ai has become a household name for meeting transcription. It's a powerful tool with great features like speaker identification and cloud syncing. But for privacy-conscious users, it has a major flaw: it lives in the cloud.

## The Privacy Gap

When you use Otter.ai, your audio is uploaded to their servers. According to their privacy policy, they may use your data to train their models (though they have enterprise opt-outs).

**InternetScribe** is different. It runs locally on your device. We literally _cannot_ access your data because it never leaves your computer.

## Feature Showdown

| Feature        | Otter.ai (Free) | InternetScribe       |
| :------------- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| **Privacy**    | Cloud-based     | **100% Local**       |
| **Cost**       | Free (Limited)  | **Free (Unlimited)** |
| **Limit**      | 300 mins/mo     | **Unlimited**        |
| **Real-time**  | Yes             | Yes                  |
| **Speaker ID** | Yes             | No (Coming Soon)     |
| **Offline**    | No              | **Yes**              |

## The Verdict

If you need to share meeting notes with a team instantly and don't mind the privacy trade-off, Otter is great.

But if you are a journalist protecting a source, a lawyer handling client data, or just someone who values privacy, **InternetScribe** is the safer choice.
