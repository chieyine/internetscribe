Descript is a cool piece of software.

I remember the first time I saw it. You delete a word in the text document, and it deletes the word in the audio file. It felt like magic. It felt like the future.

But magic comes with a price tag.

**$15 per month.** (Or $30 if you want the good features).

That’s **$180 to $360 a year**.

If you are a professional podcaster who edits 4 hours of audio a week, Descript is worth every penny. Pay them. They built a great tool for you.

But what if you aren't that person?

What if you are:

- A student transcribing an interview?
- A content creator who just needs subtitles for a Reel?
- A project manager who needs meeting notes?

If you are using Descript just to get text from audio, you are overpaying. You are buying a Ferrari to drive to the grocery store. It looks cool, but it’s a waste of money.

Here is how to get the transcription part of Descript for free, without the bloat.

## The "Real Talk": The Feature Bloat Problem

Descript started as a transcription tool. Then it became an audio editor. Then a video editor. Then a screen recorder. Then an AI voice cloner.

Every feature they add justifies a price hike.

But for many of us, we just want the raw utility: **Audio In -> Text Out.**

When you pay for Descript, you are paying for:

- Cloud storage for your video files.
- "Overdub" AI voice licensing fees.
- Stock footage libraries.
- Studio Sound processing.

If you don't use those features, you are subsidizing the people who do.

It’s time to unbundle your workflow.

## The Comparison: Unbundling the Stack

You can replicate the core Descript workflow for $0 using free, specialized tools.

| Feature           | Descript ($15/mo)        | The Free Stack                     |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Transcription** | Included (Limited Hours) | **InternetScribe (Unlimited)**     |
| **Audio Editing** | Text-Based Editing       | **Audacity (Waveform Editing)**    |
| **Video Editing** | Timeline Editor          | **DaVinci Resolve (Free Version)** |
| **Subtitles**     | Auto-Captions            | **InternetScribe (SRT Export)**    |
| **Cost**          | **$180/year**            | **$0/year**                        |

Yes, using three tools is slightly less convenient than using one. But is that convenience worth $180? For many people, the answer is no.

## 1. InternetScribe (The Transcription Engine)

**Best For:** Getting the text and subtitles.

This is the replacement for Descript’s transcription engine.

### Why It’s Better for Pure Transcription

- **No Install:** Descript is a heavy app. It updates constantly. It eats RAM. InternetScribe runs in your browser.
- **Unlimited:** Descript caps your transcription hours (10 hours/month on the Creator plan). InternetScribe is unlimited.
- **Formats:** We export to SRT and VTT, which are the standard subtitle formats. You can import these into _any_ video editor.

### The Workflow

1.  Drag your video/audio into [InternetScribe](/).
2.  Wait for the AI to process (it’s fast).
3.  Download the **SRT file**.

---

## 2. DaVinci Resolve (The Video Editor)

**Best For:** Putting those subtitles onto video.

If you are making TikToks or YouTube videos, you might be using Descript just for the captions.

DaVinci Resolve is the Hollywood standard for video editing. The free version is incredibly powerful.

### The Workflow

1.  Edit your video in Resolve.
2.  Import the **SRT file** you got from InternetScribe.
3.  Drag it onto the timeline.
4.  Style the text (font, color, shadow).

Now you have professional captions without the Descript watermark.

---

## 3. Audacity (The Audio Editor)

**Best For:** Cleaning up the audio.

Descript’s "Studio Sound" is nice, but you can do it yourself.

Audacity is free, open-source, and runs on a toaster.

### The Workflow

1.  Open your audio in Audacity.
2.  Effect -> Noise Reduction.
3.  Effect -> Compressor.
4.  Effect -> Normalize.

It takes 3 clicks to make your audio sound professional.

## The "Hidden" Angle: Vendor Lock-In

There is a danger with Descript that nobody talks about: **Proprietary Formats.**

When you edit in Descript, you are creating a `.descript` project file. Only Descript can open it. If you stop paying them, you lose access to your edits. You can export the final video, but you can't go back and change a cut unless you pay up.

When you use the Free Stack (InternetScribe + Resolve + Audacity):

- Your transcript is a `.txt` or `.srt` file. Any text editor can open it.
- Your audio is a `.wav` file.
- Your video project is a standard format.

You own your work. You aren't renting access to your own creativity.

## FAQ: Making the Switch

**Q: Can InternetScribe edit audio by deleting text?**
A: No. That is Descript’s patent-pending magic. If that specific feature is essential to your workflow, stick with Descript. But ask yourself: how often do you actually use it versus just cutting the waveform?

**Q: Is DaVinci Resolve hard to learn?**
A: It has a learning curve, yes. But learning it is a superpower. It’s a professional skill. Learning Descript is just learning a specific app.

**Q: Can I use InternetScribe for 4K video?**
A: Yes. Since we process locally, we don't care about the resolution. We just extract the audio track and process that.

## The Verdict

Descript is a luxury.

If you have the budget and the specific need for text-based editing, it’s a fantastic tool.

But if you are just looking for a way to turn speech into text and subtitles, don't pay the luxury tax.

- **Unbundle** your workflow.
- **Own** your files.
- **Save** your money.
