# Is Descript Too Expensive? Try This Free Browser Tool

Descript is cool. Being able to edit a podcast by deleting text is a neat party trick.

But let’s look at the bill.

**$15 a month.** That’s $180 a year.

If you are a professional podcaster making money from your show, pay it. It’s worth it.

But if you are:

- A student.
- Someone with a one-off project.
- Just needing the text, not the audio editing.

Then you are burning cash. You are paying for a Ferrari to drive to the grocery store.

## The "Transcription Only" Workflow

Descript bundles everything: hosting, editing, AI voice cloning, and transcription.

If you unbundle it, you save money.

**The Free Stack:**

1.  **Recording:** Audacity (Free) or QuickTime.
2.  **Transcription:** InternetScribe (Free).
3.  **Editing:** DaVinci Resolve (Free) or GarageBand.

Total cost: **$0.**

## Why Browser-Based Wins

Descript requires you to download a massive app. It updates constantly. It eats your RAM.

**InternetScribe** runs in Chrome (or Safari, or Edge).

- **No Install:** Use it on your work computer where you can't install apps.
- **No Updates:** It’s always the latest version.
- **Fast:** It uses the specialized AI hardware in your device (WebGPU) to run fast, without bogging down your whole system.

## When You SHOULD Pay for Descript

We aren't haters. Descript is great for specific people.

Pay them if:

1.  You need to remove "um" and "uh" from the _audio_ automatically.
2.  You want to clone your voice to fix a mistake.
3.  You are editing video by text.

**Don't** pay them if:

1.  You just want a transcript.
2.  You want subtitles (SRT/VTT) for YouTube.
3.  You are broke.
