Investigative journalists often deal with whistleblowers and sensitive leaks.

## The Threat Model

If you upload an interview with a whistleblower to a cloud service, you create a digital trail. If that service is subpoenaed or hacked, your source is burned.

## The Offline Advantage

**InternetScribe** allows you to transcribe interviews on an air-gapped machine (a computer not connected to the internet).

1.  Load InternetScribe (it's a PWA, so it caches).
2.  Disconnect Wi-Fi.
3.  Transcribe the interview.
4.  Delete the file.

There is no safer way to use AI.
