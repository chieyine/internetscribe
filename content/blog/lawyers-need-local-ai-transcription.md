Attorney-client privilege is the bedrock of the legal system. But in the digital age, maintaining that privilege is getting harder.

## The Cloud Risk

When you upload a client interview or deposition to a cloud transcription service, you are technically sharing that data with a third party. Even with strict NDAs, data breaches happen.

## The Local Solution

**InternetScribe** allows lawyers to transcribe sensitive audio files **without them ever leaving the office computer**.

- **No Cloud Uploads:** The AI runs locally.
- **No Third-Party Access:** No one else sees the data.
- **Ethical Compliance:** Easier to justify to ethics boards.

## Workflow for Law Firms

1.  Record client meeting.
2.  Transcribe offline using InternetScribe.
3.  Save transcript to secure local server.
