Every podcaster knows they _should_ have transcripts. But they are expensive to make.

## The Free Workflow

1.  **Record:** Record your episode as usual.
2.  **Edit:** Edit your audio in your DAW.
3.  **Export Final Mix:** Export the final MP3.
4.  **Transcribe:** Drag the final MP3 into **InternetScribe**.
5.  **Export VTT:** Export as VTT or TXT.
6.  **Publish:** Paste the text into your show notes or upload the VTT to your host.

## SEO Benefits

Google indexes text, not audio. By posting the transcript, you open up your entire episode to search engines.
