# Top 5 Rev.com Alternatives for Broke Students

Rev.com is the gold standard. $1.50 per minute for human transcription. 99% accuracy.

But you’re a student. You have a 90-minute lecture.

**90 minutes x $1.50 = $135.**

For _one_ lecture.

Unless you have a trust fund, Rev is not for you. Even their "automated" service is $0.25/minute. That’s still $22.50 for that same lecture. That’s a week of ramen.

Here is how to get your text without going broke.

---

## 1. InternetScribe (Unlimited Free)

We’re biased, but we’re also right.

- **Cost:** $0.
- **Limit:** None. Upload the whole 2-hour lecture.
- **Why:** It handles big files. It gives you a summary (so you don't even have to read the whole transcript). It exports to JSON if you're a CS major and want to do weird data stuff with it.

## 2. Your Phone's Voice Recorder (The Hack)

Most people ignore the app that came with their phone.

- **Pixel Recorder:** If you have a Pixel, this is god-tier. It transcribes live, offline, for free. It labels speakers. It’s magic.
- **iOS Voice Memos:** It doesn't transcribe _well_ yet, but you can upload the M4A file to InternetScribe later.

**Pro Tip:** Sit in the front row. Microphones aren't magic wands; they can't hear the professor if you're in the back scrolling TikTok.

## 3. Otter.ai (The "First 300 Minutes" Only)

Otter is great until it isn't.

- **The Strategy:** Use their free plan for your most important classes. You get 300 minutes a month.
- **The Trap:** Once you hit the limit, you're done. Don't rely on it for everything. Use it for the seminar where the professor talks fast, then switch to a free unlimited tool for the rest.

## 4. Microsoft Word (The "I Already Have It" Option)

Your university probably gave you a Microsoft 365 account. Use it.

- **How:** Open Word Online -> Home -> Dictate -> Transcribe.
- **The Catch:** It’s hidden in the menus. Also, it has a limit (300 min/month). But hey, combine it with Otter and you have 600 minutes.

## 5. YouTube (The Upload Hack)

This is the jankiest method, but it works.

1.  Turn your audio into a video (use a static image).
2.  Upload it to YouTube (set to Private).
3.  Wait for YouTube to auto-generate captions.
4.  Copy the transcript.

**Why do this?** YouTube’s captioning AI is actually really good at handling noise and accents. If other tools fail, YouTube might save you.

## Summary for the desperate

1.  **Pixel User?** Use Recorder.
2.  **Need a file transcribed now?** Use [InternetScribe](/).
3.  **Need human perfection?** Get a job and pay Rev.

Now go finish that paper.
