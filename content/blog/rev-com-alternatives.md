Rev.com is famous for its human transcription service ($1.50/minute). They promise 99% accuracy. But for a 1-hour interview, that's **$90**.

## The Rise of AI

AI models like Whisper (used by InternetScribe) now achieve **95-98% accuracy**.

Is that extra 1-4% accuracy worth $90? For most people, the answer is no.

## Speed

- **Rev (Human):** 12-24 hours turnaround.
- **InternetScribe (AI):** ~5 minutes for a 1-hour file (on a modern laptop).

## Privacy

Rev relies on a network of thousands of freelancers. That means a stranger is listening to your audio.

**InternetScribe** is automated and local. No human ever hears your recording.

## When to Use Rev

If you have audio with 5 people talking over each other in a noisy bar, a human might still do better. For everything else, save your money and use AI.
