Many churches record every sermon. But these recordings often sit on a hard drive, gathering digital dust.

## The Power of Text

By transcribing your sermon archive, you can:

1.  **Create Blog Posts:** Turn a Sunday sermon into 3-4 blog posts for the week.
2.  **Searchable Archive:** Allow members to search for "faith" or "hope" and find every sermon mentioning those topics.
3.  **Accessibility:** Help elderly members with hearing loss.

## The Cost Barrier

Transcribing 1,000 sermons at $1/minute = $30,000.
Transcribing 1,000 sermons with **InternetScribe** = $0.
