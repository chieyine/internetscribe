description: "Simon Says is built for video editors. Can a simple tool like InternetScribe fit into a pro video workflow?"
---

Simon Says integrates deeply with Premiere Pro and Final Cut. It's a workflow tool.

**InternetScribe** is a utility.

## The Export Workflow

While InternetScribe doesn't have a Premiere plugin (yet), it exports standard formats:

- **SRT/VTT:** Import directly as captions.
- **JSON:** Use for custom scripting.
- **TXT:** Use for paper edits.

## Cost Savings

Video production is expensive. Transcription shouldn't be. By using **InternetScribe** for your dailies and rough cuts, you can save hundreds of dollars per project.

## Conclusion

Use Simon Says for the final conform if you need deep integration. Use **InternetScribe** for everything else.
