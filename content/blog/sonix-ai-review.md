title: "Sonix.ai Review: Is it Worth the Cost?"
date: "2024-06-04"
description: "Sonix.ai is known for its speed and accuracy. But with a $10/hour price tag, is it worth it compared to free alternatives?"
---

Sonix.ai is a heavyweight in the automated transcription space. It consistently ranks high for accuracy.

## The Cost of Accuracy

Sonix charges **$10 per hour** of audio on their pay-as-you-go plan. If you have a 10-hour archive to transcribe, that's $100.

**InternetScribe** is free. That same 10-hour archive costs you $0.

## Is Sonix More Accurate?

Sonix uses its own proprietary engines. **InternetScribe** uses Whisper.

In 2024, open-source models like Whisper have largely caught up to or surpassed proprietary models. Unless you have very specific needs (like medical dictation where Sonix might have specialized models), the difference is negligible.

## Conclusion

Sonix is a great product, but the price gap is hard to justify for most users. Try **InternetScribe** first. If the accuracy isn't enough (which is rare), then consider paying.
