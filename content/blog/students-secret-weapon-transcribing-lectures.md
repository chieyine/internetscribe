Imagine having a searchable text version of every lecture from your entire semester.

- "What did the professor say about 'mitochondria' in week 3?"
- _Ctrl+F "mitochondria"_ -> Found instantly.

## How to Do It

1.  **Record:** Use your phone to record the lecture (ask permission first!).
2.  **Transcribe:** Drop the file into **InternetScribe**.
3.  **Study:** Read the transcript, highlight key points, and use the "Summarize" feature to get the gist.

## Why It's Better Than Notes

You can't write down everything. But the recording captures everything. By transcribing it, you get a perfect record that you can review at your own pace.
