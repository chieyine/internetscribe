---

Temi is owned by Rev.com and offers automated transcription for $0.25/minute. It's fast.

## The Speed Test

We tested a 10-minute file on both platforms.

- **Temi:** Upload + Processing = ~3 minutes.
- **InternetScribe:** Processing on a MacBook Pro (M1) = ~45 seconds.

## Why Local is Faster

With Temi, you have to upload the file. If you have a slow internet connection and a large video file, the upload alone can take 10 minutes.

**InternetScribe** starts processing instantly. There is no upload.

## Conclusion

For short files, it's a tie. For large files, **InternetScribe** wins on speed because you skip the upload step.
