Need to turn an MP3 recording into text? You're spoiled for choice. But not all tools are created equal. Some hide behind paywalls, others are riddled with ads, and many play fast and loose with your data.

Here is our roundup of the top 5 free tools to convert MP3 to text in 2024.

## 1. InternetScribe

**Best for:** Privacy and unlimited usage.

InternetScribe stands out because it runs entirely in your browser. It uses the open-source Whisper model to deliver high accuracy without uploading your files.

- **Pros:** 100% private, free, unlimited, supports multiple formats.
- **Cons:** Speed depends on your device's power.

## 2. Google Docs Voice Typing

**Best for:** Dictation.

If you want to speak and have it typed out, Google Docs is fantastic. However, it's not designed for uploading pre-recorded MP3 files. You have to play the audio into your microphone, which is clunky and lowers quality.

- **Pros:** Integrated into Google Docs, good accuracy.
- **Cons:** Awkward for pre-recorded files, requires online connection.

## 3. Otter.ai (Free Tier)

**Best for:** Meeting notes.

Otter is a popular choice for meetings. It offers speaker identification and cloud syncing. However, the free plan is limited to 300 minutes per month and 30 minutes per conversation.

- **Pros:** Speaker identification, cloud sync.
- **Cons:** Strict limits on free plan, not private.

## 4. Descript (Free Tier)

**Best for:** Podcasters.

Descript is a powerful audio editor that works like a word processor. It's great for editing, but the transcription limit on the free tier is very low (1 hour per month).

- **Pros:** Amazing editing features.
- **Cons:** Very restrictive free tier.

## 5. Mac Whisper

**Best for:** Mac users.

A native macOS app that wraps the Whisper model. It's fast and private, but it requires you to install an app, whereas InternetScribe works on any device with a browser.

- **Pros:** Fast, native app feel.
- **Cons:** Mac only, requires installation.

## Verdict

If you need a quick, private, and free way to convert MP3s without limits, **InternetScribe** is the clear winner. For specialized needs like podcast editing, Descript is worth a look.
