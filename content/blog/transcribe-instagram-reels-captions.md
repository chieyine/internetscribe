Instagram has auto-captions, but they are often glitchy or hard to edit.

## The Pro Workflow

1.  **Edit your Reel.**
2.  **Transcribe:** Drop the video into **InternetScribe**.
3.  **Copy Text:** Copy the transcript.
4.  **Paste as Overlay:** Paste the text into Instagram's text tool and time it manually for perfect control.

Or, use the text for your caption description!
