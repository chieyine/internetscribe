For PhD students, researchers, and journalists, transcription is often the most tedious part of the job. Hours of interviews can take days to transcribe manually.

## The Challenge

Research interviews often involve:

- Sensitive data (medical, legal, personal).
- Long durations (1-2 hours).
- Multiple speakers.

## The Solution: Automated Transcription

Using AI can cut your workload by 90%. But you have to be careful about _where_ you process that data. Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) often have strict rules about uploading participant data to the cloud.

## Why InternetScribe is IRB-Friendly

Because **InternetScribe** processes data locally on your machine, it technically counts as "local processing" rather than "cloud processing" in many jurisdictions. You aren't sending the data to a third party.

## Best Practices for Recording

1.  **Use a Dedicated Recorder:** Phones are okay, but a dedicated digital recorder often has better noise cancellation.
2.  **Test Before You Start:** Always do a 1-minute test recording to check levels.
3.  **Timestamps:** InternetScribe provides timestamps in the JSON export, which is crucial for referencing quotes in your paper.

## Workflow

1.  Record interview.
2.  Drag file to [InternetScribe](https://internetscribe.com).
3.  Export as Text.
4.  Import into NVivo or Atlas.ti for coding.
