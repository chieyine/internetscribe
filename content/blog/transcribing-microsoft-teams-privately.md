Sometimes you want personal notes from a Teams meeting without alerting the whole channel that "Transcription has started."

## The Method

1.  **Record Locally:** Use a tool like OBS or QuickTime to record your system audio.
2.  **Transcribe:** Feed that audio file into **InternetScribe**.

## Why Do This?

- **Privacy:** Keep your notes to yourself.
- **Accuracy:** Sometimes local Whisper models are better than Teams' built-in engine.
