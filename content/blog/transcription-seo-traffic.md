You spend hours making a podcast. But Google has no idea what's in it.

## The "Long Tail" Effect

If you transcribe your episode about "growing tomatoes," and someone searches "best soil for tomatoes," Google can find that exact sentence in your transcript and rank your page.

## Repurposing Content

A transcript isn't just for SEO. It's raw material.

- Turn it into a blog post.
- Turn it into a Twitter thread.
- Turn it into a newsletter.

Don't let your content die as an MP3. [Transcribe it](/).
