Language barriers are crumbling. Thanks to AI, you can now take a recording in French, Spanish, Japanese, or 90+ other languages and get an English transcript instantly.

## The "Translate" Task

Most transcription tools just transcribe what is said in the original language. **InternetScribe** has a special "Translate" mode.

## How to Use It

1.  Go to [InternetScribe](https://internetscribe.com).
2.  Open **Settings**.
3.  Under **Task**, select **"Translate to English"**.
4.  Upload your foreign audio file.

The AI will listen to the foreign speech but write down the English translation.

## Use Cases

- **Learning a Language:** Compare the original audio with the English text.
- **Foreign Films:** Create subtitles for movies that don't have them.
- **International Business:** Understand voice notes from colleagues abroad.

## Exporting Subtitles

Just like with regular transcription, you can export the translation as a VTT file. Read our guide on [Adding Subtitles to YouTube](/blog/how-to-add-subtitles-youtube-free) to see how to use these files.
