description: "Trint is a favorite among journalists. How does it stack up against the raw power of OpenAI's Whisper model?"
---

Trint was built by journalists, for journalists. It has a great interface that links text to audio.

But under the hood, the AI engine matters.

## The Whisper Advantage

**InternetScribe** uses OpenAI's Whisper model. Whisper was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual data. It is widely considered the state-of-the-art for open-source speech recognition.

In our tests, Whisper handles:

- **Accents:** Much better than older legacy models.
- **Technical Terms:** Surprisingly accurate due to its vast training data.

## The Workflow Difference

Trint is a collaborative platform. InternetScribe is a personal utility.

- **Use Trint** if you need a newsroom to collaborate on a story.
- **Use InternetScribe** if you need to transcribe an interview quickly, privately, and for free.
