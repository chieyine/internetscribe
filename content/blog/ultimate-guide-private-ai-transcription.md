In an era where data breaches are common and privacy is a luxury, the way we handle our personal information matters more than ever. This is especially true for voice data, which can contain sensitive business information, personal conversations, or confidential interviews.

## The Problem with Cloud Transcription

Traditional transcription services operate on a simple premise: you send them your audio, they process it on their servers, and send you back the text.

While convenient, this model has significant flaws:

- **Privacy Risk:** Your data is stored on third-party servers.
- **Security:** Data in transit can be intercepted.
- **Cost:** Server costs are passed on to you.
- **Limits:** Free tiers often have strict file size or duration limits.

## The Local AI Revolution

Recent advancements in WebAssembly and browser capabilities have made it possible to run sophisticated AI models directly on your device. This is often called "Edge AI" or "Local AI".

**InternetScribe** leverages this technology to run OpenAI's Whisper model right in your Chrome, Firefox, or Safari browser.

### Benefits of Local Processing

1.  **100% Privacy:** Since the data never leaves your device, it's physically impossible for us or anyone else to access your recordings.
2.  **Unlimited Usage:** We don't pay for server processing, so you don't have to pay us. Transcribe as much as you want.
3.  **Offline Capability:** Once the website is loaded (or installed as a PWA), you can transcribe without an internet connection.

## Is It Accurate?

Yes. Local models like Whisper are incredibly robust. While a massive server-side model might have a slight edge in very noisy environments, local models are more than capable for meetings, lectures, and interviews.

## The Future is Private

We believe the future of AI is personal and private. Tools that respect your data ownership will become the standard.
