If you publish video or audio, you might be legally required to provide captions.

- **ADA (USA):** Courts have ruled that commercial websites must be accessible.
- **Section 508 (USA):** Federal agencies must caption all media.
- **EAA (Europe):** The European Accessibility Act requires accessibility for e-commerce and banking.

## The Safe Bet

Even if you aren't strictly required, captioning is best practice. It protects you from lawsuits and expands your audience.
