For years, WebGL was the standard for 3D on the web. But it was designed for games, not AI.

## Enter WebGPU

WebGPU gives web developers low-level access to the GPU. This allows us to run parallel computations—like matrix multiplications used in neural networks—blazing fast.

## What This Means for InternetScribe

Currently, we use WebAssembly (CPU). But we are actively experimenting with WebGPU backends. This could make transcription **10x faster**, allowing real-time transcription even on mobile phones.

The future is fast. Read about [The Future of Offline AI](/blog/future-of-offline-ai).
