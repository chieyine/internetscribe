---

For years, Google Speech-to-Text was the gold standard for automated transcription. It was fast, reliable, and integrated into everything.

Then came OpenAI's Whisper.

Released as an open-source model, Whisper changed the game. But how does it actually compare to the giant?

## The Contenders

- **Google Speech-to-Text:** A cloud-based API. You send audio, it returns text. It's trained on massive datasets and is very good at handling different accents.
- **Whisper (via InternetScribe):** An open-source neural net that runs locally. It's known for its robustness to background noise and technical language.

## Round 1: Accuracy

In our tests, **Whisper (Small model)** consistently outperformed Google in handling:

- Fast speech
- Heavy accents
- Background noise (like a coffee shop)
- Technical jargon

Google is still excellent, but Whisper often captures the _nuance_ better, including punctuation.

## Round 2: Privacy

**Winner: Whisper (Local).**
Google requires you to upload audio to their cloud. Whisper, when run on [InternetScribe](https://internetscribe.com), processes everything on your device. Google never hears a word.

## Round 3: Cost

**Winner: Whisper.**
Google charges per minute after a free tier. Whisper is free and open-source.

## Conclusion

If you need a cloud API for an app, Google is a solid choice. But for personal use, accuracy, and privacy, Whisper is the new king.
