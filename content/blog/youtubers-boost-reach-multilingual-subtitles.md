MrBeast dubs his videos in multiple languages. You might not have his budget, but you can have his subtitles.

## The Strategy

1.  **Transcribe in English:** Use **InternetScribe** to get the English captions.
2.  **Translate:** Use our "Translate" task (or an external tool) to generate subtitles in Spanish, Portuguese, etc.
3.  **Upload:** Upload these subtitle files to YouTube.

## The Result

YouTube will now index your video in those languages. If someone searches for your topic in Spanish, your video might show up.
